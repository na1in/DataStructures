# MazeRunner

Developed a maze generating application that utilizes data structures in Java to demonstrate the use of graphs along with Kruskal's and Dijkstra's algorithms to generate a random maze by removing as few walls as possible and allowing the client to find the shortest path between the initial and final positions. The application is based on OOP(Object Oriented Programming) principles.
